### User stories

- we want the user to be able to anwser the flash cards and shown the correct answer.
- we want the user to be able to make their own personalizer cards based on their needs
- we as the developer need to be able to store mutiple different data on the local storage
- we as the developer need to be able to track the user daily action and show it a calendar
- We want the user to be able to view their activity on a calendar

### Problem Domain
Many people have challenges when studying new concepts. Each person has their own method for studying material and remembering concepts. This flash card application allows users to create and study their own customized flashcards. Users can also view their flashcard history to track their progress.

### Software Requirements

We want to create a webpage that helps make learning or studing a new language easier by making flash cards that help with memorization. The user can also create their own cards or what we call decks to help suite their needs at the time. This can also help teacher or instructor in their class to be a more fun and exciting way of teaching!
Our website ins are 
- Base cards help learn language that we agree on 
- user can add multiple desks for different subjects
- Store users activity like scores and how many he got right and display bthem on a calendar
- store the users created deck in local storage 

Our outs are 
- Never going to be monetized so it can be free to the public
- Sell user information to third party companies


The MVP of this project is to have the base model of cards work and having the user creating there own decks and dislaying scores. on the other hand the stretch goals are the calendar to show results and if we want to add images to the flash cards created by the user
