## Cooperation Plan

Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.

Describe at least:

- What are the key strengths of each person on the team?


- How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?


- In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?


- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?


## Conflict Plan

Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

Describe at least:

- What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

Everyone on the team will have their opinion heard. If two resolutions or opinions conflict, we will verbally discuss solutions and identify potential agreements.

- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

To help mitigate one person taking over the project, we will assign roles and QA helper roles. With this method, multiple people will be involved in various aspects of the project.


- How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

Our team will work individually and in pairs to complete features/challenges of this project. For timing conflicts, we will allows team members to work on their portion on the project and schedule daily scrum times to report

- How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?


- How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?


## Communication Plan

Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

Describe at least:

- What hours will you be available to communicate?


- What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?


- How often will you take breaks?


- What is your plan if you start to fall behind?


- How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?


- What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?


- How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?

##Work Plan

- Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.
